# 1. Boot testing
So first we grabbed one PC with following specs:
  OPTIPLEX 7010<br />
  RAM: 4GB DDR3 SDRAM (Upgrade to 8GB planned) <br />
  CPU: Intel Core i5 3570 @3,4 Ghz <br />
  HDD: Generic 80GB HDD <br />

Like you see, the specs are pretty low, but we will get multiple PCs pretty soon so the specs will combine and get better.
So, we flashed CachyOS Desktop on a USB Flash Drive, because it has customization and performance improvement. We plugged the USB in the PC, and it booted successfully.

To be continued...
